In 1965. Gordon Moore noticed that the number of transistors (tiny electronic switches) on a
computer chip was doubling about every two years. More transistors mean faster and more powerful
computers, so for many years, computers kept getting much faster and more capable at a steady pace.

In recent years, Moore's Law has slowed down, and it's not as true as it used to be. This is because
we’re running into physical limitations that make it very hard to keep squeezing more and more
transistors onto a chip. Here’s why:

1. As we pack more transistors onto a chip (transistor density increases), the power consumption goes
up. With more power, the chip generates more heat. Too much heat can cause the chip to fail or slow
down, and cooling becomes a major problem.

2. When transistors switch on and off, they use something called dynamic power, which is related to
how fast they run and how much voltage is applied. Reducing the voltage can help lower power consumption,
since lower voltage reduces dynamic power. However, voltage scaling can only help so much because
there are limits.

3. Lowering the voltage isn’t a perfect solution. As you reduce the voltage, leakage power becomes a
bigger problem. Leakage power is when transistors use energy even when they’re not switching. This
power loss still happens, even with lower voltage. Also, voltage can only be reduced to a certain point
because if it gets too low, the chip becomes more sensitive to noise or crosses the threshold voltage
where transistors don’t work reliably.
